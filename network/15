# Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

# Solution:
# /etc/hosts should be modified like this:

# 192.168.50.10        cdn.42.fr
# 46.19.122.85         cdn.intra.42.fr
# 127.0.0.1       localhost
# 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
# ::1             localhost

# Obviously, I can't do thus, cuz no sudo rights.
